# JamShare

JamShare enables musicians to share music by allowing them to easily and quickly listen in and play in turn a live stream with their cohorts Jamming in an online connected session. This application makes it easy for people to plug and play their MIDI instruments or use the device microphone to allow anyone with access to the [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) web browser download the combined streams mixed together at the end of the round.
